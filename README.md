# Soldered Documentation

![Soldered Documentation](/soldered-documentation/static/img/soldered_docs_social_card.jpg?raw=true)

Welcome to the **Soldered Documentation** repository! This repository hosts all official documentation for Soldered products, which is published at [soldered.com/documentation](https://soldered.com/documentation). The documentation is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

### This documentation is a work in progress!

Some features of this documentation like **search** and all the supporting pages are still a work in progress! We're working on adding all our products to this new documentation, including our sensors, actuators, Inkplate and Dasduino boards and batteries. So, please be patient with us as we continue to work on it!
