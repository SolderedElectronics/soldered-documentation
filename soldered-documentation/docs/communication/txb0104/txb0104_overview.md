## Logic Level Converter TXB0104 Board

This board is designed for signal conversion for almost any communication protocol. It uses a specialized integrated circuit that enables high-speed communication.

The Logic Level Converter TXB0104 Board provides **bidirectional** voltage level translation between two signals, enabling **communication** between devices **operating at different logic voltages**. Whether you're connecting a 5V microcontroller to a 3.3V sensor or working with other voltage combinations, this module ensures compatibility while **protecting lower-voltage components from damage**.

<InfoBox>

**Should not be used in applications such as I2C, 1-Wire, or an MMC card interface** where an open-drain driver is connected to the bidirectional data I/O.

If you need one for **I2C communication**, we offer an [**I2C TXS0104 board**](https://soldered.com/product/logic-level-converter-i2c-txs0104-breakout/).
