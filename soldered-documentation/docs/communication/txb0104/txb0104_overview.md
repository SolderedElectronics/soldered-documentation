## Logic Level Converter TXB0104 Board

This board is specialized for signal conversion for almost any communication protocol, and for this conversion, it uses a special integrated circuit that enables communication at high speeds.

<InfoBox>**Should not be used in applications such as I2C, 1-Wire, or an MMC card
interface** where an open-drain driver is connected on the bidirectional data I/O.</InfoBox>

The Logic Level Converter TXB0104 Board **bidirectional** voltage level translation between two signals, enabling **communication** between devices **operating at different logic voltages**. Whether you're connecting a 5V microcontroller to a 3.3V sensor or working with other voltage combinations, this module ensures compatibility while **protecting lower-voltage components from damage**.
