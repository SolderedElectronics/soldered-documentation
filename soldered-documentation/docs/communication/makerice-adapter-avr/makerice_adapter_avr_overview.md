The **Atmel ICE AVR** is a breakout adapter for the **Atmel-ICE** programmer. This breakout enables a fast and reliable connection to any **AVR** microcontroller with its pin positioning. This passive breakout board connects the 10-pin IDC port of the Atmel ICE to two common AVR programming interfaces: the 6-pin ICSP/ISP header and the 3-pin UPDI header.

It is perfect for modernt AVR development, including UPDI-based **tinyAVR**, **megaAVR-0**, and **AVRDx series**, as well as classic **ISP-programmed ATmega and ATtiny** devices.

It is ideal for engineers, educators and makers who want a clean, compact and dependable programming setup.
