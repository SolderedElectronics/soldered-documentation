## CAN Transceiver MCP2518 board

The Controller Area Network (CAN) Transciever is a network technology that enables **fast communication between microcontrollers**, and is the most commonly used standard in cars. Our CAN breakout uses an **MCP2518FD CAN**whose communication between microcontrollers takes place on SPI protocol. This breakout allows use of both standards, **CAN 2.0B** and **CAN Flexible Data**, access to the CAN bus is possible via **CANH** and **CANL** pins on terminal. The 120 ohm terminator resistor is also located on the board and can be connected to a jumper (for more details check out Jumper details section of HArdware details page).
