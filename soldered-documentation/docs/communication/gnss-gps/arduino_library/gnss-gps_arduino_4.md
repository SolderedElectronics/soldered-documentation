This page contains some helpful tips if you are having problems using your L86-M33 GNSS GPS module.

<ExpandableSection title="My GPS module won't initialize!">

#### Check wiring  
Ensure that your GPS module is properly connected to your microcontroller. Double-check the wiring for the VCC, GND, TX, and RX pins. If you’re using a UART interface, make sure the TX from the GPS goes to the RX on the microcontroller and vice versa.  

#### Power supply  
Make sure your GPS module is receiving sufficient power. The L86-M33 typically operates at 3.3V to 5V. If using a 3.3V supply, ensure that the regulator can handle the current requirements.

#### Check serial communication  
If you are using UART, make sure you have correctly configured your baud rate and serial port in your code. The default baud rate for the L86-M33 is usually 9600, but it may vary depending on your settings.

#### Try reinitializing  
If the module fails to initialize on the first attempt, try resetting it by calling `GPS.begin()` or rebooting your microcontroller. Some initialization problems can be fixed by a simple reset.

#### Clear line of sight  
Ensure that the GPS module has a clear line of sight to the sky. GPS signals are weak, and obstructions such as buildings or dense trees can interfere with signal reception. Try moving to an open area for better satellite visibility.

#### Wait for a cold start  
When using the GPS module for the first time, it might take longer to acquire a fix, especially if it has not been used in the vicinity before. Allow the module 5-10 minutes to acquire satellite signals during a cold start.

#### Improve antenna placement  
If you’re using an external antenna, ensure that it’s placed properly and connected securely. The antenna should have a clear view of the sky to get optimal signal reception.  

#### Test in a different environment  
GPS performance can be affected by environmental factors like heavy cloud cover or high interference. Try testing the GPS module in a different location, preferably outdoors with clear skies.

<ExpandableSection title="Other common issues">

#### My GPS module is giving inaccurate coordinates  
Verify the satellite signal  
If the GPS module is only picking up a few satellites, the coordinates may be inaccurate. Ensure that it has a strong signal from at least 4-6 satellites for accurate positioning.

#### GPS module doesn't output coordinates after firmware update  
Revert to Previous Version  
If you recently updated the firmware on your microcontroller or GPS module and the issue arose afterward, you may want to try reverting to the previous firmware version to see if that resolves the issue.

#### Slow or intermittent GPS fixes  
Check for interference  
If the GPS module is giving intermittent fixes, ensure that there is minimal interference from other electronic devices and that the module has an unobstructed view of the sky. Additionally, check if the antenna is working correctly.

#### GPS data is fluctuating  
Check power supply  
Inconsistent or fluctuating power can lead to erratic readings from the GPS module. Make sure your microcontroller is providing stable power to the GPS module and that there are no power supply issues.

#### My GPS module is not responding to commands  
Check wiring and serial communication  
Ensure that your GPS module’s TX and RX pins are properly connected and that you are using the correct baud rate. Incorrect wiring or serial settings can cause the GPS to appear unresponsive.

#### GPS signal loss after a few minutes  
Check power and heat  
If the GPS module is losing signal after a few minutes of use, it may be overheating or drawing too much current. Ensure that the power supply is sufficient and that the GPS module is not exposed to excessive heat.
