The **RS-232 Transceiver Breakout Board** by [**Soldered**](https://soldered.com/product/rs-232-transciever-breakout/) enables seamless communication between devices using the **RS-232 protocol**. It leverages the **MAX232E integrated circuit**, which converts RS-232 voltage levels (±3V to ±15V) to TTL/CMOS logic levels (0V to 5V) and vice versa. This ensures compatibility between modern microcontrollers and legacy RS-232 devices.

## How it works

The **RS-232 Transceiver Breakout Board** acts like a translator for your devices. It takes the high-voltage signals used in RS-232 communication (±3V to ±15V) and converts them into the low-voltage signals (0V to 5V) that modern microcontrollers and logic devices understand—and it works the other way around, which is all made possible due to the **MAX232E chip** onboard that handles all the heavy lifting.

Main points:

*   The **charge pump circuit** inside the MAX232E generates the higher voltages needed for RS-232 communication from a simple 5V power supply.  
*   It has two channels for sending data (**DIN1/DIN2 to DOUT1/DOUT2**) and two for receiving data (**RIN1/RIN2 to ROUT1/ROUT2**), so you can send and receive at the same time (full-duplex communication).
  
<InfoBox>Plus, it’s built with **ESD protection**, so it won’t fry if there’s static electricity or electrical noise.</InfoBox>

## Enable and Disable

The MAX232E operates as long as a stable 5V supply is provided. When unpowered, it can safely remain connected to active RS-232 devices without causing damage, thanks to its internal safeguards.

## How to Connect It?

*   **Connect Power**:  
    *   Attach the **5V pin** to your power source (4.5V - 5.5V range).     
    *   Connect the **GND pin** to the ground of both your microcontroller and RS-232 device.
        
*   **Wiring the Signals**: 
    *   Connect the **DIN1/DIN2 pins** to the TTL/CMOS data outputs of your microcontroller.   
    *   Connect the **ROUT1/ROUT2 pins** to the TTL/CMOS data inputs of your microcontroller.  
    *   Attach the **RIN1/RIN2 pins** to the RS-232 data outputs of your external device.   
    *   Attach the **DOUT1/DOUT2 pins** to the RS-232 data inputs of your external device.
        

This breakout board is ideal for interfacing modern microcontrollers with legacy or industrial systems requiring RS-232 communication, such as modems, barcode scanners, or industrial equipment.
