## CONNECT Programmer

The **CONNECT Programmer** is your go-to solution for **fast**, **hassle-free** programming of **ESP8266** and **ESP32** microcontroller boards. Designed with simplicity and reliability in mind, it eliminates the need for manual button pressing or external circuitry.

Just plug a USB-C cable into the CONNECT Programmer, connect it to your ESP board, and you're ready to go. All the necessary electronics, including those that manage signal timing and boot mode activation, are built right in. It automatically handles the reset and boot sequence required to enter **programming mode**, making firmware uploads smooth and straightforward.

Optimized for Soldered's own boards that feature the CONNECT programming header, the CONNECT Programmer is also fully compatible with any ESP8266 or ESP32 board that lacks a built-in USB-to-UART converter.

Whether you're prototyping or **flashing firmware at a large scale**, the CONNECT Programmer streamlines the process—so you can spend **less time debugging** connections and more time building.
