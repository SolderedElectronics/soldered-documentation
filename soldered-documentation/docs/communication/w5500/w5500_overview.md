## Ethernet controller W5500 board

The **W5500** is a Hardwired **TCP/IP** embedded Ethernet controller that provides easier Internet connection to embedded systems. W5500 enables users to have the
Internet connectivity in their applications just by using the single chip in which
TCP/IP stack, 10/100 Ethernet MAC and PHY embedded. WIZnet‘s Hardwired TCP/IP is the market-proven technology that supports TCP, UDP, IPv4, ICMP, ARP, IGMP, and PPPoE protocols. W5500 embeds the 32Kbyte internal memory buffer for the Ethernet packet processing. If you use W5500, you can implement the Ethernet application just by adding the simple socket program.

SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is provided for easy integration with the external MCU. The W5500’s SPI supports **80 MHz** speed and new **efficient SPI** protocol for the **high speed** network communication. In order to reduce power consumption of the system, W5500 provides **WOL** (Wake on LAN) and **power down** mode.
