## Ethernet controller W5500 board

The **W5500** is a hardwired **TCP/IP** embedded Ethernet controller that provides an easier Internet connection for embedded systems. W5500 enables users to add Internet connectivity to their applications with a single chip that embeds a TCP/IP stack and integrates a 10/100 Ethernet MAC and PHY. WIZnet's hardwired TCP/IP is a market-proven technology that supports TCP, UDP, IPv4, ICMP, ARP, IGMP, and PPPoE protocols. W5500 includes a 32Kbyte internal memory buffer for Ethernet packet processing. By using the W5500, you can implement Ethernet applications with a simple socket program.

SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is provided for easy integration with an external MCU. The W5500â€™s SPI supports **80 MHz** speed and a new **efficient SPI** protocol for **high-speed** network communication. To reduce the system's power consumption, the W5500 provides **WOL** (Wake on LAN) and a **power down** mode.
