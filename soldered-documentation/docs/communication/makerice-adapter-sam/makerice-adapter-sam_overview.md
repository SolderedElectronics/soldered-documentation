## MakerICE Adapter SAM

The **MakerICE Adapter SAM** is a breakout adapter for the **Atmel-ICE** programmer. This breakout enables a fast and reliable connection to any **SAM** microcontroller with its pin positioning. With direct signal routing for **SWDIO**, **CLK**, **SWO**, **nRST**, **VGT** and **GND** this adapter ensures reliable communication between your Atmel ICE and any SWD-capable target.

It's ideal for engineers, educators and advanced makers working with SAM devices, the board provides a stable interface for development and testing.
