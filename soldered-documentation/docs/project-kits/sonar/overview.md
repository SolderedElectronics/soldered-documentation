## Introduction
**Sonar Project Kit** guides users in creating their own version of simple object detection system. In this project we'll go through each step in creating your own object detection system using a laser sensor and LCD display to represent objects. By the end of this project, you'll have a better understanding of individual components and how they work together.

## How it works
The system is built on ESP32 microcontroller along with a laser sensor which emitts a short laser pulse that reflects off objects to get their presence and distance, the sensor is attached to a servo motor that performs a 180Â° sweep for detection. Once an object is detected it is represented out on graphical radar-like display.
