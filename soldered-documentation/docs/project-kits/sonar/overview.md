## Introduction
**Sonar Project Kit** guides users in creating their own version of simple sonar object detection system. In this project we'll go through each step in creating your own object detection system using an ultrasonic sensor and LCD display to represent objects. By the end of this project, you'll have a better understanding of hardware/software connection.

## How it works
The system is built on ESP32 microcontroller along with an ultrasonic sensor which uses sound waves that bounce off objects to get their presence and distance, the sensor is attached to a servo motor that performs a 180Â° sweep for detection. Once an object is detected it is represented out on graphical radar-like display.
