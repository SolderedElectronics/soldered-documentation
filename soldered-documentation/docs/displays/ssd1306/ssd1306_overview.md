## SSD1306 0.96" I2C OLED Display

Looking to add visuals to your Arduino projects? The **I2C OLED breakout board** is perfect for that. Thanks to its high contrast, you'll be in awe of its crisp visuals! The display is composed of hundreds of LEDs, with each representing one pixel in a **128×64** grid. Thus, it doesn't require a backlight, and it uses less power than classic LCD screens. That’s 8192 pixels, all individually lit at your fingertips!

It is straightforward to use because it communicates via **I2C** with a hardware-defined address of **0x3C** and is designed for seamless **Qwiic (formerly easyC) connectivity**.
