## LCD I2C adapter

This LCD I2C Adapter simplifies the connection between your **LCD display** and any **Arduino-compatible board**, such as Dasduino. Utilizing I2C communication, it only requires two pins for operation, making setup quick and straightforward.

Our **LCD I2C displays** come with the adapter soldered on, which enables characters to be displayed on the LCD screen via the I2C bus.

With our **provided library**, you can get started in just a few minutes. Plus, with **Qwiic (formerly easyC) connectivity**, no soldering is required, making the process even more convenient!
