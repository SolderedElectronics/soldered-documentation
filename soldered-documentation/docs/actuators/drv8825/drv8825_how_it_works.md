This is a **DRV8825 Stepper motor board** designed for precise control of stepper motors. This breakout board features the **DRV8825** driver, which supports **microstepping** down to **1/32** of a regular step. This board also has **overcurrent** and **overtemperature protection**. A built-in **potentiometer** enables easy **current regulation**.

## Stepper Motor Basics

A **stepper motor** is a type of motor that moves in discrete steps rather than continuous rotation like a DC motor. It does this by energizing different coils (or phases) in a sequence. There are two main types of stepper motors:  

- **Bipolar stepper motors** have two coils and require **H-bridge control** to reverse the direction of current flow in each coil. This breakout board provides that control using **four NPN transistors** to switch the motor windings.  
- **Unipolar stepper motors** have a center tap on each coil, allowing them to be driven more simply, though they are less efficient. This driver can also be used with unipolar stepper motors by only energizing one side of each coil at a time.

## Driving the Stepper Motor

The **DIR** and **STEP** pins on the board serve as control pins. The **DIR** pin is used to set the rotation direction—**LOW for clockwise** and **HIGH for counterclockwise**. Each **HIGH** pulse sent to the **STEP** pin moves the motor one step. The output pins **B2**, **B1**, **A1**, and **A2** control the flow of current from **VIN** through the motor winding to ground in sequential order, which allows the stepper motor to move step by step.

<InfoBox>The IN pins can work at **3V3** or **5V** logic</InfoBox>
<WarningBox>**45V is the maximum** supported Motor supply voltage **with heatsink!**</WarningBox>
