This is a **DRV8424P dual motor H-bridge driver breakout** designed to control two brushed DC motors or one bipolar stepper motor. It uses the **DRV8424P** driver from Texas Instruments, which allows for **bidirectional control**, **adjustable current regulation**, and **low power sleep mode**.

## What does the DRV8424P do?

The DRV8424P enables efficient, precise control of two DC motors or one bipolar stepper motor. It offers **peak currents up to 2A per H-bridge** and supports both **PWM** and **PH/EN** control schemes. The device includes several protections:

- **Overcurrent protection**
- **Undervoltage lockout**
- **Overtemperature shutdown**
- **Fault indication pin (FAULT)**

It operates over a wide voltage range (**4.5V to 33V**) and supports fast switching thanks to its internal low-RDS(on) FETs.

## Motor control overview

Each H-bridge (A and B) is driven by a pair of logic pins:

- **IN1 / IN2**: Sets the direction and speed via PWM or logic level.
- **SLEEP**: An active-low pin used to put the driver into low-power mode.
- **FAULT**: An open-drain, active-low output that signals a fault condition.

To control a **DC motor**, connect it to the **OUT1** and **OUT2** pins of one H-bridge. To control a **stepper motor**, use both H-bridges simultaneously: one for coil A and one for coil B.

---  

## Example configuration

For typical brushed DC motor usage:

- **AIN1 / AIN2** and **BIN1 / BIN2** are controlled via PWM or logic levels to adjust speed and direction.
- Pull **SLEEP** high to activate the driver.
- Monitor **FAULT** for safety issues.

For a bipolar stepper motor:

- Use both A and B bridges to control coil pairs.
- A common sequence (e.g., full-step, half-step, microstepping) energizes each pair accordingly.

<InfoBox>Logic pins are compatible with **3.3V and 5V microcontrollers**</InfoBox>
