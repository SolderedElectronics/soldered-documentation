## Dual motor H-bridge driver DRV8424P

The **DRV8424P dual H-bridge motor driver breakout** is a compact, efficient solution for driving two DC motors or one bipolar stepper motor. It supports motor supply voltages from **4.5V to 33V**, and delivers up to **1.5A continuous current per H-bridge** (with heatsinking), making it ideal for medium-power motor control applications.

With **built-in current regulation**, **adjustable decay modes**, and **low-power sleep mode**, the DRV8424P driver enables flexible and energy-efficient motion control. It is easily interfaced with microcontrollers like Arduino and supports PWM input for speed and direction control.
