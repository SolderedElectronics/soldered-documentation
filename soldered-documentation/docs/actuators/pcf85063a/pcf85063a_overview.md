## PCF85063A Real-time clock

The **PCF85063A Real-time clock** is a device that carefully and precisely tracks time and dates. It is extremely precise, making it more suitable for long-term time tracking than the clocks found on microcontrollers. This breakout can operate on extremely low current, and thanks to its **alarm feature** and **interrupt pin**, it allows a microcontroller to enter sleep mode until it is awakened by this RTC.

It has a **built-in battery holder** (battery not included), and even if power is lost, real-time tracking won’t be affected.

It is simple to use since it communicates via **I2C** with a hardware-defined address of **0x51** and is designed for seamless **Qwiic (formerly easyC) connectivity**.
