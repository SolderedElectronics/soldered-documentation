## Relay board

The **Relay board** is an electronic switch that is activated by a signal sent from microcontroller. It's used in applications where it is needed to turn on and off a device that needs large current or voltage. It works both on AC and DC. It comes in 1, 2 or 4 channel version and it also comes in versions with **I2C communication** (only 1 and 2 channel versions) which is designed for seamless **Qwiic (formerly easyC) connectivity**—eliminating the need for soldering.
