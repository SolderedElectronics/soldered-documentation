This page provides troubleshooting steps to help resolve common issues when using WS2812B smart LEDs with an Arduino or other microcontrollers.  

<ExpandableSection title="My LEDs won’t turn on!">  

#### Check wiring connections  
Ensure that the **VCC, GND, and DIN** connections are correct and secure. WS2812B LEDs typically require **5V power**, and the **DIN pin** must be connected to a digital output pin on your microcontroller.  

#### Verify power supply  
The LED strip may require more power than your microcontroller can supply. Use an **external 5V power source** with sufficient current (e.g., **1A per 30 LEDs**). Also, connect the **ground (GND) of the power supply** to the microcontroller’s GND.  

#### Ensure correct data voltage  
WS2812B LEDs use **5V logic**, while some microcontrollers (like ESP8266 or ESP32) use **3.3V logic**. A **logic level shifter** may be required to properly drive the data signal.

<ExpandableSection title="My LEDs are flickering or showing the wrong colors!">  

#### Use a resistor on the data line  
A **330Ω – 470Ω resistor** in series with the **DIN** line can help prevent voltage spikes and improve signal stability.  

#### Add a capacitor to stabilize power  
Place a **1000µF capacitor (6.3V or higher)** across **VCC and GND** to reduce voltage fluctuations that may cause flickering.  

#### Reduce wire length or use shielded cables  
Long wires between the microcontroller and the LED strip can degrade the data signal. Keep wires as short as possible, or use a **twisted pair cable** to reduce interference.  

#### Check your code and timing  
Ensure your code is using the correct **LED library** (e.g., **FastLED** or **Adafruit NeoPixel**) and that the correct **chipset type** is selected. Some libraries require specific timing settings for stable operation.

<ExpandableSection title="Other common issues">  

#### My LED strip is only lighting up the first LED  
- **Incorrect signal timing**: Ensure you are using the correct data speed and format for WS2812B LEDs.  
- **Defective first LED**: If the first LED is damaged, it may block data transmission. Try connecting the **DIN pin to the second LED’s input** instead.  

#### My WS2812B strip is heating up too much  
- **Excessive brightness**: Running all LEDs at full brightness continuously generates heat. Reduce brightness in your code.  
- **Insufficient power handling**: Ensure your power supply can handle the total current draw of the LED strip.  

#### My LED strip is not responding to data signals  
- **Check microcontroller pin functionality**: Verify that the GPIO pin used for **DIN** is correctly configured and working.  
- **Test with a different microcontroller**: If possible, try controlling the LEDs with another board to rule out hardware issues.
