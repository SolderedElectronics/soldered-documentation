### Pin details

| Pin Marking | Pin Name      | Description                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **VCC**     | Power (+5V)   | Supplies power to the LED strip. Typically powered by a 5V source.   |
| **GND**     | Ground        | Common ground for both the power and signal.                         |
| **DIN**     | Data Input    | Input pin for receiving the data signal from the microcontroller.    |
| **DOUT**    | Data Output   | Output pin for passing the data signal to the next LED (in a chain). |

<InfoBox>The **DIN** pin is used to receive data from a microcontroller such as an Arduino or Raspberry Pi. The **DOUT** pin passes the data to the next LED in a daisy-chained setup.</InfoBox>
<WarningBox>Ensure a stable **5V** power supply to avoid damage to the LEDs!</WarningBox>

## Power and Voltage Requirements

The **WS2812B** operates with a **5V** supply, which is typically delivered to the **VCC** pin. It can handle up to **60mA** per LED at full white (RGB) brightness, and power consumption will depend on the color and brightness settings used.

- **Operating Voltage:** 5V DC
- **Current Consumption:** Up to 60mA per LED at full brightness (white color)
- **Power Supply Recommendation:** Use a **5V DC power supply** that can provide sufficient current for the total number of LEDs in the chain.

<WarningBox>Ensure that the power supply can handle the total current draw. For example, a 1-meter strip with 30 LEDs at full brightness can draw up to 1.8A of current.</WarningBox>

## Control Protocol

The **WS2812B** LEDs use a **single-wire** control protocol for data transmission. The data is sent in a **serial protocol**, meaning that the data is transmitted one bit at a time, allowing for precise control of each individual LED in the strip.

- **Control Protocol:** Single-wire (data)
- **Microcontroller Compatibility:** Compatible with **Arduino**, **Raspberry Pi**, and other microcontrollers with a **PWM** output.
