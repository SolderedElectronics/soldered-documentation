The **LED matrix** is a circuit board that contains a system of **64 interconnected LEDs** that are controlled by onboard **MAX7219 LED driver** by [**Adafruit**](https://www.adafruit.com/product/453).

## How the driver works

The MAX7219 uses a 3-wire SPI-compatible protocol with **DIN** (**data in**), **CLK** (**clock**), and **LOAD** (**chip select**) pins. Data is shifted into the chip, controlling the LED states through an internal shift register. The driver can control up to **8 digits of a 7-segment display** or an **8x8 LED matrix**. It achieves this through **multiplexing** , meaning it quickly switches between LED segments to make them appear continuously lit to human eye.

## Internal Registers

The MAX7219 has several registers that control different parameters.
    - **Digit registers:** Store which segments should be lit.
    - **Decode mode:** Selects whether t interpret data as BCD or raw binary
    - **Intensity control:** Adjusts brightness via PWM
    - **Scan Limit:** Defines how many rows in matrix are active
    - **Shutdown mode:** Turns off the display to save power
