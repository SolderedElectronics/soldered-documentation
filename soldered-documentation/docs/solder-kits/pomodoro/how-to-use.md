## Introduction

This page explains how to **use and configure** your **Pomodoro Timer Solder Kit** once it’s assembled.

<InfoBox>The **first two digits** on the display represent the **focus** (work) time in minutes, while the **last two digits** indicate the **break** (rest) time in minutes.<br></br><br></br>Example: 25 05 → 25 minutes focus, 5 minutes break.</InfoBox>

## Power on & setup mode

When you plug in the USB-C cable, the timer **turns on with default settings**:

- Default time: **25 minutes focus** and **5 minutes break**  
- The **RGB LED blinks purple** → this means you are in **setup mode**  
- The **currently editable digits flash** → these are the values you can increase or decrease  

At startup, the timer will first let you set the **focus minutes** (first two digits).

## Adjusting the value with UP and DOWN

Use the **UP** and **DOWN** push buttons to change the current flashing value:

- If the **first two digits** are flashing → you are adjusting **focus time (minutes)**
- If the **last two digits** are flashing → you are adjusting **break time (minutes)**

Press:

- **UP** → increases the value  
- **DOWN** → decreases the value

## Confirm focus time & switch to break time

When you’re happy with your **focus time** (first two digits):

- Press **Start/Stop** once  
- The selection moves to the **break time** (last two digits), which now start flashing  

Now repeat the same process:

- Use **UP** and **DOWN** to set how long your **break** should last.

## Start the timer (focus vs rest)

When you’re satisfied with both **focus** and **break** values:

- Press **Start/Stop** again  
- The timer **starts counting down** from the focus time  

The RGB LED indicates the current phase:

- **Red LED** → **focus time** (time to work)  
- **Green LED** → **break time** (time to rest)  

The display shows the remaining time for the current phase.

## Pause and resume

At any time while the timer is counting down (focus or break):

- Press **Start/Stop** to **pause** the timer  
- Press **Start/Stop** again to **resume**  

The display will stop counting while paused and continue from the same value when resumed.

## Yellow warning before phase change

Whenever there is **one minute left** before switching to the next phase:

- The RGB LED turns **yellow**  
- This serves as a **warning** that the current focus or rest period is about to end  

Example:

- 1 minute before focus ends and break begins → LED turns yellow  
- 1 minute before break ends and focus begins → LED turns yellow

## Reset to default settings

At any point, you can fully reset the timer back to its default Pomodoro values:

- Press **Reset**  
- Timer returns to **25 minutes focus** and **5 minutes break**  
- You return to the **setup mode** with the LED blinking purple and the digits flashing  

This is useful if you’ve experimented with different times and want to go back to the classic Pomodoro cycle.

- **Start/Stop (in setup)** → Switch between focus time and break time setup  
- **Start/Stop (while running)** → Pause / resume countdown
