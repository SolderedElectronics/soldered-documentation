# Overview

## Introduction

The **Pomodoro Timer Solder Kit** is a hands-on soldering project that combines **electronics education** with **productivity enhancement**. Based on the **RP2040 microcontroller**, this kit allows you to build a fully customizable timer that follows the popular Pomodoro work-rest technique. Whether you prefer 25-minute work sessions with 5-minute breaks or longer 45/15 intervals, this timer can be easily adjusted in 5-minute increments.

Designed as a **Level 2 soldering challenge**, it helps intermediate makers refine their soldering skills while assembling a practical and stylish desktop productivity tool. The finished timer features a **four-digit 7-segment display**, **RGB LED for visual status indication**, and a **programmable buzzer** for session alerts. It’s powered via **USB-C** and can be **reprogrammed in MicroPython**, giving you complete control over timing, colors, and melodies.
