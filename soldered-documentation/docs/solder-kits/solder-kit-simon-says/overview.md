## Introduction
Simon says is an educational electronics kit that teaches you how to solder, and eventually, you get your own small game. The goal of the game is to press the buttons in the same order as LEDs turn on. With every win, the gamebecomdes increasingly challenging. The kit is based on the STM32 MCU, programmed in Arduino. On the back, you'll find a CR2032 battery that makes the kit portable. It also includes a keychain holder. The soldering process is made easy by the marks on the PCB.
