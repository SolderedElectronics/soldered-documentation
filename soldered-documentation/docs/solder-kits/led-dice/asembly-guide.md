On this page, we will guide step by step on how to assemble this kit.

## Step 1: Solder the resistors to the PCB.
Use a multimeter to differentiate resistor based on their resistance value. Start by putting the multimeter in resistance measuring mode and connect the multimeter's probes to the ends of the resistor, separate them based on the resistance value.

### Solder the 330hm resitors
Solder the 330Ohm resistors to the bpc on pins marked **R2-R8**. Their orientation doesn't matter.

Find the resistors with markings as shown below:

### Solder the 10kOhm resistors
Solder the 10kOhm resistors to the pcb on pins marked **R1**. Their orientation doesn't matter. 

Find the resistors with markings as shown below:

## Step 4: Solder the switch
Solder the switch on pins marked **S1**, orientation doesn't matter.

## Step 5: Solder the CR2032 battery holder
Rotate the pcb on its back side up and align the holder with drawn topology on pins marked **BAT**.
