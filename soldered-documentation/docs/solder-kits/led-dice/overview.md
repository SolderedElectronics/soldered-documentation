## Introduction
**The LED dice Solder kit** is an educational kit that teaches you how to solder, and by the end, you get your own LED dice. The kit is based on the Attiny404 MCU, programmed in Arduino. On the back, you'll find a CR2032 battery that makes the kit portable. It also includes a keychain holder. The soldering process is made easy by the marks on the PCB.

## What Does It Do?
By shaking the dice, the onboard **SW-18020P Vibration sensor** activates the Attiny404 MCu and it generates a random number from 1 to 6 and displays it with LED diodes.
