## Introduction
**The Reaction Game** is an educational kit that teaches you how to solder, and by the end, you get your own small game. The kit is based on the STM32 MCU, programmed in Arduino. On the back, you'll find a CR2032 battery that makes the kit portable. It also includes a keychain holder. The soldering process is made easy by the marks on the PCB.

## What Does It Do?
The goal of the game is to press the button next to the LED as soon as it turns on. With every win, the game becomes increasingly challenging, and the speed at which the LEDs switch increases as the game progresses.
