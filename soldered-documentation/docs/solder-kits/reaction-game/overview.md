## Introduction
Reaction game is an educational kit that teaches you how to solder, and in the end you get your own small game. Goal of the game is to press the button next to the LED as soon as it turns on. With every win, game becomes increasingly challenging. The kit is based on the STM32 MCU, programmed in Arduino. On the back, you'll find a CR2032 battery that makes the kit portable. It also includes a keychain holder. The soldering process is made easy by the marks on the PCB.
