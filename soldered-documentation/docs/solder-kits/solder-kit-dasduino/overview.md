## Introduction
**Make your own Dasduino** is an educational electronics kit that teaches you how to solder, with which you end up with a functional microcontroller board. It is based on the ATmega328P microcontroller, and all SMD components are already soldered on the board. The set also includes a THT socket for the microcontroller, which simplifies the replacement of the microcontroller should it ever become necessary.

## What does it do
When this kit is fully assembled, it functions as any ATmega328P-based microcontroler board.
