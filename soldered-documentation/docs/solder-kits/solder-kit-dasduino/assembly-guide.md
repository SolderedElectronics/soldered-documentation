On this page, we will guide step by step on how to assemble this kit.

## Step 1: Solder the resistors to the PCB.
Use a multimeter to differentiate resistor based on their resistance value. Start by putting the multimeter in resistance measuring mode and connect the multimeter's probes to the ends of the resistor, separate them based on the resistance value.

### Solder the 2.2kOhm resistors
Solder the 2.2kOhm resistors to the pcb on pins marked **R2**, **R4**, **R6**,**R14**,**R17**. Their orientation doesn't matter.

### Solder the 10kOhm resistors
Solder the 10kOhm resistors to the pcb on pins marked **R8**, **R9**, **R11**,**R12**,**R13**. Their orientation doesn't matter.

### Solder the 1kOhm resistors
Solder the 1kOhm resistors to the pbc on pins marked **R1**, **R3**, **R5**. Their orientation doesn't matter.

### Solder the 100Ohm resitors
Solder the 100Ohm resistors to the bpc on pins marked **R18**. Their orientation doesn't matter.

### Solder the 100kOhm resitors
Solder the 100Ohm resistors to the bpc on pins marked **R15**. Their orientation doesn't matter.

## Step 2: Solder the capacitors
Use a multimeter to differentate capacitors based on their capacitance value. Start by putting the multimeter in capacitance measuring mode and connect the multimeter's probes to the ends of the capacitor, separate them based on the capacitance value.

### Solder the 100nF capacitors
Solder the 100nF capacitors to the pcb on pins marked **C1**,**C2**,**C3**,**C4**,**C7**,**C9**,**C10**. These capacitors are **non-polarized capacitors**, which means that their orientation doesn't matter.

### Solder the 2.2uF capacitors
Solder the 100nF capacitors to the pcb on pins marked **C8**,**C11**,**C12**,**C13**. These capacitors are **polarized capacitors**, which means that their anode (+) must be soldered to + marked side on pins.

### Solder the 22pF capacitors
Solder the 100nF capacitors to the pcb on pins marked **C5**,**C6**. These capacitors are **non-polarized capacitors**, which means that their orientation doesn't matter.

## Step 3: Solder the LEDs
Solder the LEDs to the pcb in the order provided below:

| **LED Color** 	| **Pin number** 	|
|---	|---	|
| Purple 	| D2 	|
| Red 	| D5 	|
| Blue 	| D6 	|
| White 	| D7 	|
| Orange 	| D13 	|

## Step 4: Solder the JST battery connector
Solder the JST battery connctor to the pcb on pins marked **K3**, make sure that the connector covers it's drawn topology (That it's facing outwards).

## Step 5: Solder the ATmega328P Socket
Solder the socket to the pbc on pins marked **U2** (its drawn topology).
