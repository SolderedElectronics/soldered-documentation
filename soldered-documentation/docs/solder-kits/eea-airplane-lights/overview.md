## Introduction

EEA Airplane lights is an educational electronics kit that teaches you how to solder, and eventually, you will get your own plane that maybe doesn't fly but it has some cool lights. The kit is based on a XD555 timer so no programming is needed. On the back, you will find a CR2032 battery that makes the kit portable. It also includes a keychain holder. The soldering process is made easy by the marks on the PCB.
