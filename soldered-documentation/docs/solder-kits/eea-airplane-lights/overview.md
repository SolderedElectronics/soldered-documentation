## Introduction

EEA Airplane Lights is an educational electronics kit that teaches you how to solder. Eventually, you will get your own plane; although it may not fly, it features some cool lights. The kit is based on an XD555 timer, so no programming is needed. On the back, you will find a CR2032 battery that makes the kit portable. It also includes a keychain holder. The soldering process is made easy by the marks on the PCB.

## What does it do?
This kit is specifically designed to replicate the flashing light patterns commonly found on most standard aircraft. By mimicking the visual signals used by airplanes, it provides a realistic and authentic lighting effect.
