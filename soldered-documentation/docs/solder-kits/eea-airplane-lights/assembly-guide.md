On this page, we will guide step by step on how to assemble this kit.

## Step 1: Solder the resistors to the PCB.

Use a multimeter to differentiate resistor based on their resistance value. Start by putting the multimeter in resistance measuring mode and connect the multimeter's probes to the ends of the resistor, separate them based on the resistance value.

### Solder the 330 Ohm ressitors

Solder the 330 Ohm resistors to the pcb on pins marked **R1, R2, R3**. Their orientation doesn't matter.

### Solder the 10k Ohm resistor

Solder the 10k ohm resistor to the pcb on pins marked  **R4**. Their orientation doesn't matter.

### Solder the 100k Ohm resistor

Solder the 100k Ohm resistor to the pins marked **R5**

## Step 2: Solder the capacitors

Use a multimeter to differentate capacitors based on their capacitance value. Start by putting the multimeter in capacitance measuring mode and connect the multimeter's probes to the ends of the capacitor, separate them based on the capacitance value.

### Solder the 10nF capacitor

Solder the 10nF capacitor to the pcb on pins marked **C1**. This capacitor is a **non-polarized capacitor**, which means that the placement orientation doesn't matter.

### Solder the 10uF capacitor

Solder the 10uF capacitor to the pcb on pins marked **C2**. This capacitor is a **polarized capacitor**, which means that ist anode (+) must be soldered to + marked side on pins.

## Step 3: Solder the LEDs

Solder the LEDs to the pcb in the order provided in the table below:

| **LED COLOR** | **PIN NUMBER** |
|---------------|----------------|
| RED           | D1             |
| WHITE         | D3             |
| GREEN         | D2             |

## Step 4: Solder the switch
Solder the switch on pins marked **S1**, orientation doesn't matter.

## Step 5: Solder the XD555 timer
Solder the XD555 timer on pins marked **U1**. Make shure that the **side with an indent is facing the front of the plane**

## Step 6: Solder the CR2032 battery holder
Rotate the pcb on its back side up and align the holder with drawn topology on pins marked **K1**.
