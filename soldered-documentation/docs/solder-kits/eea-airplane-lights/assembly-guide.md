On this page, we will guide you step-by-step on how to assemble this kit.

## Step 1: Solder the resistors to the PCB.
Use a multimeter to differentiate resistors based on their resistance values. Start by setting the multimeter to resistance mode and connecting its probes to the ends of the resistor to determine its resistance value.

### Solder the 330 Ohm resistors
Solder the 330 Ohm resistors to the PCB on the pins marked **R1, R2, R3**. Their orientation doesn't matter.

Find the resistors with markings as shown below:

<InfoBox> We will place the components as shown in the picture above. However, for convenience, we will rotate the PCBs and solder the components from the bottom side.</InfoBox>

### Solder the 10k Ohm resistor
Solder the 10k Ohm resistor to the PCB on the pin marked **R4**. Its orientation doesn't matter. 

Find the resistors with markings as shown below:

### Solder the 100k Ohm resistor
Solder the 100k Ohm resistor to the pin marked **R5**.

Find the resistors with markings as shown below:

## Step 2: Solder the capacitors
Use a multimeter to differentiate capacitors based on their capacitance values. Start by setting the multimeter to capacitance mode and connecting its probes to the leads of the capacitor to determine its capacitance value.

### Solder the 10nF capacitor
Solder the 10nF capacitor to the PCB on the pin marked **C1**. This capacitor is a **non-polarized capacitor**, which means that its placement orientation doesn't matter.

### Solder the 10uF capacitor
Solder the 10uF capacitor to the PCB on the pin marked **C2**. This capacitor is a **polarized capacitor**, which means that its anode (+) must be soldered to the side marked with a +.

## Step 3: Solder the LEDs
Solder the LEDs to the PCB in the order provided in the table below:
| **LED COLOR** | **PIN NUMBER** |
|---------------|----------------|
| RED           | D1             |
| WHITE         | D3             |
| GREEN         | D2             |
