The goal of this example is to show you how to **read a button input** and then display a message on an **LCD** when that button is pressed.  
We will be using the **Soldered LCD library** to control the display, making it simple to write text.

<SuccessBox>

**In this documentation you will learn:**

- How to download and set a custom arduino library.
- Basics of I2C communication.
- How to initialize and control an LCD using the **Soldered LCD library** (`LCD-SOLDERED.h`).
- How to clear the screen, position the cursor, and print text (`lcd.clear()`, `lcd.setCursor()`, `lcd.print()`).
</SuccessBox>

**Hardware required:**

- 1× Soldered NULA RP2040 board  
- 1× 16x2 Qwiic LDC display 
- 1× Push button  
- 1× 10k ohm resistor (pull-down) 
- 1x Qwiic connector 
- Jumper wires  
- Breadboard  
- USB-C cable

## Putting the components together

### 1. Connect the LCD
Use a **Qwiic cable** to connect the LCD module to the NULA board. That’s it — no extra wiring required! The Qwiic system carries **power (3.3V), ground, SDA, and SCL** through a single connector.

### 2. Connect the button
- Connect one leg of the button to **IO03** pin on the NULA board.  
- Connect the opposite leg to **3.3V**.  
- Add a **10 kΩ resistor** between the IO03 leg and **GND**.

## Setting up the LCD

Before you start programming the actual example, you need to download the **Soldered LCD Library**. This library is just a piece of code that has some premade functions that make it easier to use the module.

Go to `https://github.com/SolderedElectronics/Soldered-LCD-Library` and download the repository as a zip file.

<CenteredImage src="/img/nula-beginner-kit-arduino/library1.png" alt="Downloading the library" caption="Downloading the library from Github"/>

<InfoBox>It is recomended to move the downloaded library into a dedicated folder rather than keeping it in the Downloads folder.</InfoBox>

Inside the **Arduino IDE** navigate to: `Sketch->Include Library->Add .ZIP Library...`.

<CenteredImage src="/img/nula-beginner-kit-arduino/library2.png" alt="Including the library inside Arduino IDE" caption="Including the library inside Arduino IDE"/>

Locate the downloaded library and you are all set.

## Basics of I2C Communication

I2C is a way for electronic devices to **talk to each other using only two wires**:
- **SDA (data line)** carries the actual information.
- **SCL (clock line)** tells the device when to send or read the data.

One device acts as the **controller** (in this case, your NULA board), and the others are **peripherals** (like the LCD). Each peripheral has a unique **address**, so the NULA knows which device it’s talking to.  

The advantage of I²C is that you can connect **many devices** to the same two wires, and they won’t interfere with each other as long as they have different addresses.  

When you use the **Qwiic connector**, all of this wiring (power, ground, SDA, and SCL) is already included in one simple cable, making it much easier for beginners.

## Initializing the Display
Before we can actually do anything with the library, we need to include it in the file by writting: `#include "LCD-SOLDERED.h"` at the top of the file. After that we need to create an object from the LCD class. In this example we will use the `lcd(column, row)` constructor. Before we can use most of the modules, we need to initialize them (especially the qwiic ones). We do this by calling the `lcd.begin()` function inside **setup()** function.

```cpp
#include "LCD-SOLDERED.h"   // Include the Soldered LCD library

/*
Create an LCD object. 
The parameters (16, 2) mean the LCD has 16 columns and 2 rows.
*/
LCD lcd(16,2);

void setup() {
  /*
  Initialize the LCD so it is ready to use.
  */
  lcd.begin();
}

```

## Displaying the message

In this example, the LCD shows "Button pressed!" when the button is pressed. Otherwise, it stays blank. We first turn the backlight on with `lcd.backlight()` and clear the screen using `lcd.clear()`, then position the cursor `lcd.setCursor(column, row)`, and finally print the message with `lcd.print("text")`.

```cpp
void setup(){
    //...

    //Turn on the LCD backlight (if the display module supports it). 
    lcd.backlight(); 
}

void loop(){
    lcd.clear();
    lcd.setCursor(0,0);
    lcd.print("text");
    delay(50);
}
```
