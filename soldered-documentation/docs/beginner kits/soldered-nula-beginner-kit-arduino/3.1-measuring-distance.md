The goal of this example is to show you how to **measure distance** using an **ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04** and the NULA MINI board.  
The sensor uses **ultrasonic sound waves** to determine how far an object is from it by measuring the time it takes for a sound pulse to travel to the object and back.  
The calculated distance is displayed in **centimeters** on the **Serial Monitor**.

<SuccessBox>
**In this documentation you will learn:**
- How the **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** works.  
- How to connect and read data from the sensor using the NULA MINI board.  
- How to calculate distance using the **speed of sound**.  
- How to display the result in the Serial Monitor.
</SuccessBox>

## Hardware required
- 1× Soldered NULA MINI board  
- 1× HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor  
- 1× Breadboard  
- Jumper wires  
- USB-C cable

## Putting the components together

### 1. Connect the ultrasonic sensor
The HC-SR04 has **four pins**: **VCC**, **TRIG**, **ECHO**, and **GND**.  
We connect the sensor to the NULA MINI as shown below.

| **HC-SR04 Pin** | **NULA MINI Pin** |
|------------------|-------------------|
| VCC | 3.3V |
| TRIG | IO4 |
| ECHO | IO3 |
| GND | GND |

<InfoBox>
The HC-SR04 sensor is typically designed for **5V**, but it also works on **3.3V** with slightly reduced range.  
Make sure to connect both **TRIG** and **ECHO** pins directly to NULA MINI GPIO pins, so no level shifter is required.

## How the Ultrasonic Sensor Works
The **HC-SR04** ultrasonic sensor measures distance by using sound waves that travel through the air. Whan the program starts a measurement, the **TRIG** pin sends out a short ultrasonic pulse, a burst of sound waves at about **40 kHz**, whisc is far above human hearing spectrum. These sound waves move forward until they hit a nearby object. Once they reach that surface, they bounce back toward the sensor, and the **ECHO** pin detects their return.

The sensor then measures the time between sending and receiving the sound pulse. Since the **speed of sound** in air is approximately **343 meters per second**, or `0.0343` cm/us, we can calculate the distance the sound traveled:

` Distance = (Duration * 0.0343) / 2`

<InfoBox>Because the sound wave must travel to the object and then back to the sensor, the measured time is divided by two to get the one-way distance. </InfoBox>

## Code
Below is the full example code that measures distance and prints it to the Serial Monitor at 115200 baud!
```cpp
#include "Ultrasonic-distance-sensor-easyC-SOLDERED.h"   // Include Soldered Ultrasonic Sensor library

// --- Pin definitions ---
#define TRIG_PIN  4     // Trigger pin for the ultrasonic sensor
#define ECHO_PIN  3     // Echo pin for the ultrasonic sensor

// --- Create ultrasonic sensor object ---
Ultrasonic_Sensor hc(TRIG_PIN, ECHO_PIN);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);   // Start Serial Monitor communication
  hc.begin();             // Initialize the ultrasonic sensor

  Serial.println("Ultrasonic Measuring Distance Example started!");
  Serial.println("Move an object in front of the sensor to see the distance change.");
}

void loop() {
  // --- Measure distance in centimeters ---
  float distance = hc.getDistance();

  // --- Print distance to Serial Monitor ---
  Serial.print("Distance: ");
  Serial.print(distance, 2);
  Serial.println(" cm");

  delay(500);  // Short delay between readings
}
```
