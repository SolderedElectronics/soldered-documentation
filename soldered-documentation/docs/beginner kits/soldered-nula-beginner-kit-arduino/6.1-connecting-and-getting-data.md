The goal of this example is to show you how to **connect the NULA MINI to a Wi-Fi network** and make a simple **HTTP GET request** to retrieve data from a webpage.  
This is the foundation of all Internet-connected projects. Once your device can send and receive data over the network, you can build dashboards, cloud sensors, and remote controls.

**In this documentation you will learn:**
- How to connect your **NULA MINI** to a Wi-Fi network.  
- How to use the **Wi-Fi** and **HTTPClient** libraries.  
- How to perform a basic **HTTP GET request**.  
- How to print the server’s response to the **Serial Monitor**.

## Hardware required

- 1× Soldered NULA MINI board (with Wi-Fi support)  
- 1× USB-C cable  
- Wi-Fi network with internet access

## Setting up the libraries
This example uses two built-in libraries, so **no extra installation is required**:
- `Wifi.h` handles network connections
- `HTTPClient.h` allows sending HTTP requests and receiving responses.

## Connecting to Wi-Fi

To connect to the internet, your board must join a Wi-Fi network.  
This is done by providing your **Wi-Fi SSID (network name)** and **password** inside the code.

```cpp
const char* ssid = "Your_SSID";
const char* password = "Your_PASSWORD";
```
When the sketch runs, the board will attempt to connect to this network and print its status to the Serial Monitor.

## Making a simple GET request 
Once connected to the network, the board can contact a server on the internet. A **GET request** asks for information, in the cae of this example, the content of `example.com`.
```cpp
HTTPClient http;
String url="http://example.com/";
http.begin(url);    // Connect to the server
int httpCode=http.GET();    // Send the GET request
```

If successful, the server returns a response and the website's HTML content, which is then printed on the Serial Monitor:
