The goal of this example is to show you how to **display a simple message** on an **LCD screen** using the **Soldered LCD library**.  
You will learn how to initialize the display, turn on its backlight, and print text to specific positions on the screen.  
This example serves as your first introduction to **displaying information** on a 16×2 LCD module connected to the NULA MINI.

**In this documentation you will learn:**

- How to download and set a custom arduino library.
- Basics of I2C communication.
- How to initialize and control an LCD using the **Soldered LCD library** (`LCD-SOLDERED.h`).
- How to clear the screen, position the cursor, and print text (`lcd.clear()`, `lcd.setCursor()`, `lcd.print()`).
</SuccessBox>

**Hardware required:**

- 1× Soldered NULA MINI board  
- 1× 16×2 Qwiic LCD display  
- 1× Qwiic connector  
- Breadboard (optional, only for mounting)  
- USB-C cable

## Putting the components together

### 1. Connect the LCD
Use a **Qwiic cable** to connect the LCD module to the NULA MINI board. That’s it — no extra wiring required! The Qwiic system carries **power (3.3V), ground, SDA, and SCL** through a single connector.

## Setting up the LCD Library

Before you start programming the actual example, you need to download the **Soldered LCD Library**. This library is just a piece of code that has some premade functions that make it easier to use the module.

Go to `https://github.com/SolderedElectronics/Soldered-LCD-Library` and download the repository as a zip file.

<CenteredImage src="/img/nula-beginner-kit-arduino/library1.png" alt="Downloading the library" caption="Downloading the library from Github"/>

<InfoBox>It is recomended to move the downloaded library into a dedicated folder rather than keeping it in the Downloads folder.</InfoBox>

Inside the **Arduino IDE** navigate to: `Sketch->Include Library->Add .ZIP Library...`.

<CenteredImage src="/img/nula-beginner-kit-arduino/library2.png" alt="Including the library inside Arduino IDE" caption="Including the library inside Arduino IDE"/>

Locate the downloaded library and you are all set.

## Basics of I2C Communication

I2C is a way for electronic devices to **talk to each other using only two wires**:
- **SDA (data line)** carries the actual information.
- **SCL (clock line)** tells the device when to send or read the data.

One device acts as the **controller** (in this case, your NULA board), and the others are **peripherals** (like the LCD). Each peripheral has a unique **address**, so the NULA knows which device it’s talking to.  

The advantage of I²C is that you can connect **many devices** to the same two wires, and they won’t interfere with each other as long as they have different addresses.  

When you use the **Qwiic connector**, all of this wiring (power, ground, SDA, and SCL) is already included in one simple cable, making it much easier for beginners.

## Initializing the Display
Before we can actually do anything with the library, we need to include it in the file by writting: `#include "LCD-SOLDERED.h"` at the top of the file. After that we need to create an object from the LCD class. In this example we will use the `lcd(column, row)` constructor. Before we can use most of the modules, we need to initialize them (especially the qwiic ones). We do this by calling the `lcd.begin()` function inside **setup()** function.

```cpp
#include "LCD-SOLDERED.h"   // Include the Soldered LCD library

/*
Create an LCD object. 
The parameters (16, 2) mean the LCD has 16 columns and 2 rows.
*/
LCD lcd(16,2);

void setup() {
  /*
  Initialize the LCD so it is ready to use.
  */
  lcd.begin();
}

```

## Displaying the message

Now that the LCD is initialized, we can print text to it using lcd.print().
We use lcd.setCursor(column, row) to control where on the screen the message appears.
The top-left corner of the display is position (0, 0).

```cpp
void setup(){
lcd.begin();
  lcd.backlight();

  lcd.clear();           // Clear any previous text
  lcd.setCursor(0, 0);   // Start at the first row, first column
  lcd.print("Hello, NULA!");

  lcd.setCursor(0, 1);   // Move to the second row
  lcd.print("Let's get started!");
}

void loop(){
}
```
