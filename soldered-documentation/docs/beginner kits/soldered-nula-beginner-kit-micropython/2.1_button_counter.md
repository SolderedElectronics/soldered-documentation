Another fundamental concept in embedded systems, alongside controlling pin states, is reading the state of a pin. By declaring a pin as an input, we can determine its **state** (HIGH or LOW), we can also read **analog value**, **detect edges** (FALLING, RISING), **interrupts** and more. This example focuses on reading basic digital input from a pushbutton.

### Pushbutton

- Before you assemble the circuit it's important to know how a pushbutton works.
- A pushbutton is a simple switch that remains open when it is **not pressed**, but closes the circuit when it is **pressed** allowing current to flow.

- Pushbuttons are "momentary", meaning they only make contact while being pressed, so to ensure stable reading and avoid floating values (changing from HIGH to LOW and vice versa), a **PULL-UP** or **PULL-DOWN** resistor is used. See this **[blog post](https://soldered.com/learn/what-is-a-pull-up-pull-down-resistor)** for an in-depth tutorial on this concept.

## Putting the components together

- Place the pushbutton on the breadboard, connect one terminal of the button to pin 19, and the other terminal to 3.3V or VCC.

## Code Example

Import `Pin` module for button pin setup.

```python
from machine import Pin
import time
```

Declare the pin number connected to pushbutton and create a `Pin` object set as an input with `PULL-DOWN` resistor so the pin reads **LOW** (0) when the button is not pressed.

```python
button_pin = 19
btn = Pin(button_pin, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_DOWN)
```

Initialize counter variable to keep track of number of times the button was pressed.

```python
counter = 0
```

Main loop that constantly reads currnt voltage level of the button pin, checks the moment when button is pressed (when the value is **HIGH**) and then increments the counter variable. 

```python
while True:
    # Read current voltage level of the button pin (0 when not pressed, 1 when pressed)
    current_state = btn.value()

    # Check for moment when button is pressed, pull-down configuration reads LOW (0) when not pressed
    # and HIGH (1) when pressed
    if current_state == 1:
        # Increment counter variable and print its value to the console
        counter += 1
        print("Button pressed, count:", counter)

    time.sleep_ms(10) # Pause the program briefly to allow some time for CPU
```

<InfoBox> You may notice that one button press increments the number by more than one time, this is expected behaviour which will be explained in detail on the next page! </InfoBox>
