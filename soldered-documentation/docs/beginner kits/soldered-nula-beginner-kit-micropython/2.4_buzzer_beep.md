In this example we will use a passive buzzer to play a melody. The buzzer functions like a small speaker, it requires AC audio signal to produce sound. To make it play different melodies and tones we simply change the frequency of the signal sent to it.

**At the end of this example you will learn:**
- How to play sound/melody from a passive buzzer
- How to use PWM for different frequencies

**Parts required:**
- **Soldered NULA Mini Board**
- **Breadboard**
- **1 x Buzzer**
- **Some jumper wires**

## Putting the components together

- Place the buzzer in the breadboard, connect the positive pin to GPIO 5, and negative to GND.
- Positive pin should be labeled on top of the buzzer.

## Code Example

Import necessary modules, `PWM` is used to control the tone output from the buzzer.

```python
from machine import Pin, PWM
import time
```

Create a `PWM` object on pin 5.

```python
buzzer = PWM(Pin(5))
```

Here we define some common notes along with their frequencies in Hz.

```python
C4 = 262
D4 = 294
E4 = 330
F4 = 349
G4 = 392
A4 = 440
```

Out of those notes we defined, we can create a melody by putting them in a list. We also set duration to play each note.

```python
melody = [C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, A4, G4, F4, E4, D4, C4]
duration = 200
```

Loop through the melody and play each note with a small pause in between. In the end disable the PWM output for the buzzer.

```python
for note in melody:
    buzzer.freq(note)           # Set buzzer frequency based on the note
    buzzer.duty(512)            # 50% duty (sound on)
    time.sleep_ms(duration)     # Play note for defined duration
    buzzer.duty(0)              # 0% duty (sound off)
    time.sleep_ms(150)          # Short pause between notes

buzzer.deinit()
```
