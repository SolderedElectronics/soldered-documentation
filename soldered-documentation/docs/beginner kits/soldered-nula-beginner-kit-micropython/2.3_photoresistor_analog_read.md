Along with reading digital inputs, we can also measure analog values using the built-in **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)** on the **NULA Mini** board. While digital inputs can only detect two states (**HIGH** or **LOW**), analog inputs represent a continuous range of values. In this example we'll use a **photoresistor (LDR)** to measure the intensity of light which then changes its resistance. **NULA Mini** by default converts the voltage (ranging from 0V to 3.3V) into a number between **0 - 4095 (12-bit ADC)**.

**At the end of this example you will learn:**
- How to use a photoresistor
- How to read analog values

## Putting the components together

<CenteredImage src="/img/under_construction.png" alt="Under construction" caption="Required components" width="400px" />

- Place each leg in different row on the breadboard, connect one end to **VCC** and the other end to the pin on your board. From that same row then connect with **330Ohm** resistor to GND.

## Code Example

Along with `Pin` module we import the `ADC` which allows us to create the object of that type which will be used to read analog values from a pin.

```python
from machine import Pin, ADC
import time
```

Define pin used for LDR sensor and create an `ADC` object for that pin.

```python
LDR_PIN = 5
ldr = ADC(Pin(LDR_PIN))
```

Main loop which reads the analog value from that pin and prints it over to serial.

```python
while True:
    # Read the analog value from the photoresistor (0 - 1023)
    ldr_value = ldr.read()
    
    # Print the LDR value to the console
    print(f"LDR Value: {ldr_value}")
    
    # Pause the program briefly to allow some time for CPU
    time.sleep(0.5)
```
