Using the **SHTC3 Temperature and Humidity sensor** we can accurately measure temperature and humidity values. This example uses SHTC3 sensor with its MicroPython module to measure data and print it out.

<SuccessBox>
**At the end of this example you will learn:**
- How to connect SHTC3 sensor to NULA Mini board using Qwiic cable
- How to connect SHTC3 sensor to NULA Mini board using native version
- How to read sensor values and display them
</SuccessBox>

<InfoBox>
**Parts required:**
- **Soldered NULA Mini Board**
- **Breadboard**
- **SHTC3 Temperature and Humidity sensor**
- **1 x Qwiic cable**
</InfoBox>

## Putting the components together

- If you are using the **Qwiic** just plug one end in the NULA Mini board and one in the SHTC3
- If you are not using the Qwiic connector, **manually** connect your board using the table below:

| NULA Mini | SHTC3 |
|:----:|:----:|
| VCC | VCC |
| GND | GND |
| SDA | IO3 |
| SCL | IO4 |

## Code Example

Import necessary `machine` modules and `SHTC3` module for sensor setup and initialization.

```python
from machine import Pin, I2C
from SHTC3 import SHTC3
import time
```

Setup I2C connection with the sensor using custom I2C pins and initialize the `SHTC3` object. 

```python
i2c = I2C(0, scl=Pin(4), sda=Pin(3))
shtc3 = SHTC3(i2c)
```

If you are using Qwiic connector initialize object in this way.

```python
# Initialize sensor over Qwiic
# shtc3 = SHTC3()
```

Main loop that samples values before reading them and printing them out to console. The code samples values every 5 seconds.

```python
# Infinite loop
while True:
    # Sample the values before reading them
    shtc3.sample()
    # Read the temperature and humidity values that were just sampled
    temperature = shtc3.readTemperature()
    humidity = shtc3.readHumidity()
    # Print the values to the console
    print(f"Temperature: {temperature:.1f}, Humidity: {humidity:.2f}%")

    # Pause the program for five seconds
    time.sleep(5.0)
```
