One of the key features of the **NULA Mini** board is its built-in **WiFi 6** support, making this board perfect for wireless projects. This example covers how we can use **HTTP GET** request to request data from a specified URL. Returned data depends on what the website or API provides. In this example we will request data from **Webhook.site**, which is a free online tool that let's us test and debug **HTTP** requests.

**At the end of this example you will learn:**
- How to connect **NULA Mini** to existing WiFi network
- How to make a **HTTP GET** request

## Code Example

To connect to a WiFi network import `network` library, `urequests` will be used for HTTP GET request.

```python
import network
import urequests
```

Set the `ssid` and `password` variables to hold the SSID and password of the existing WiFi network you want to connect to.

```python
ssid = ""
password = ""
```

Create a `WLAN` network object and set the board to act as a WiFi station, in this mode the board acts as a client, connecting to an existing WiFi network. 

```python
wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
```

Activate the network interface and connect to the network using `ssid` and `password` variables.

```python
wlan.active(True)
wlan.connect(ssid, password)
```

To make a GET request we need internet connection, so we ensure that we do not proceed further without WiFi connection. After successful connection print out IP config parameters.

```python
while wlan.isconnected() == False:
    pass

# Print IP parameters: IP address, subnet mask, gateway and DNS server
print('Connection successful')
print(f"IP config: {wlan.ifconfig()}")
```

Define your `Webhook` URL by putting in your unique ID which can be found on their website.

```python
request_url = "https://webhook.site/YOUR_UNIQUE_ID"
```

`urequests.get()` function sends an HTTP GET request to the specified URL and stores the result in `response` variable.

```python
print(f"Making GET request to: {request_url}")
response = urequests.get(request_url)
```

Print out the HTTP status code returned by the server. Some common examples:
- `200` — **OK (request was successful)**
- `404` — **Not found (URL doesn't exist)**
- `500` — **Server Error**

```python
print("Response status:", response.status_code)
```

This prints the body (main content) of the server's response, most common responses are webpage (HTML format) and JSON data.

```python
print("Response body:\n", response.text)
```
