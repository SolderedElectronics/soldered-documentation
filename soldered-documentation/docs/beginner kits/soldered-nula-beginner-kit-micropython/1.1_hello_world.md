Serial communication is a method of exchanging data between a computer and your **NULA Mini** board or any other microcontroller. MicroPython uses **REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop)**, which is a interactive prompt always available on the **UARRT0** serial peripheral (**baudrate** set to **115200**) that you can access from NULA Mini board. Using REPL makes it very easy to test out your code, print sensor data or run direct commands from the terminal.
