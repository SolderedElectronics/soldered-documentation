MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library. It is designed to run on microcontrollers and embedded systems.

## How MicroPython Works

Unlike full Python interpreters, MicroPython is optimized to run with minimal hardware resources, making it ideal for microcontroller environments. You can write Python code, upload it to a board, and interact with sensors, actuators, displays, and more using familiar syntax.

A typical MicroPython script runs directly on the microcontroller and can:
- Read and write digital/analog pins
- Communicate over I2C, SPI, UART
- Perform file operations (e.g., on internal flash or SD cards)
- Utilize onboard peripherals such as timers, ADCs, PWMs, etc.

## Why Use MicroPython?

- Easy to learn and use, especially for beginners
- Interactive REPL allows rapid development and debugging
- Lightweight and fast for many common embedded tasks
- Supported on many boards: ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico, STM32, and more
