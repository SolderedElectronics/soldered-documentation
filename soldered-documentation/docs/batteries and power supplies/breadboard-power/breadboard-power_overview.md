## Breadboard power supply

The **Breadboard power supply** is a simple and stable power source for your breadboard projects. Supply it with power via the DC jack or with a USB-C cable, and the board provides 3.3V, 5V, or 12V directly to the power supply lines on the breadboard. Output voltages are adjustable separately using the onboard switches. It also includes a power LED, a power switch, and an automatic voltage selection circuit in case both power inputs are connected.
