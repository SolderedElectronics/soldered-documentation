## How it supplies power

The board supports a 12V DC input as well as a 5V USB-C input.

You can also use the 12V input to obtain a 5V output thanks to the onboard **7805 voltage regulator**, which can regulate input voltages from 7V to 35V into a 5V output:

The **S1** switch can turn the power supply on/off, while With the **S2 and S3 switches**, you can pick your desired voltage for all your maker needs! Find more information about the switches [**here**](/breadboard-power/hardware#switch-details)
