The **CN3791** is a **PWM** switch-mode lithium-ion battery charger controller that can be powered by a photovoltaic cell with maximum power point tracking functionality using only a few external components. The CN3791 is specially designed for charging lithium-ion batteries using constant current and constant voltage modes. In constant voltage mode, the regulated voltage is fixed at **4.2V** with Â±1% accuracy.
