The **Joystick 2-axis with pushbutton breakout board** is a circuit board with onboard **GGL002** Joystick module. It has an integrated pushbutton that is activated by pressing the head of Joystick.

---

## How the module works

The module integrates **2 potentiometers**, one for **X other for Y axis**, with a **gimbal system**. When Joystick is moved, **gimbal system slides** on on the corresponding **potentiometer's whiper** changing value of the output signal on both axis.
