# Overview 

## TMP117 Temperature Sensor

The **TMP117** is a high-accuracy, low-power digital temperature sensor with an **SMBus™- and I²C-compatible interface**. It provides **16-bit temperature measurements** with a resolution of **0.0078 °C per LSB** and an accuracy of up to **±0.1 °C** (–20 °C to 50 °C) without the need for calibration.

Designed to meet **ASTM E1112** and **ISO 80601-2-56** standards, the TMP117 is suitable for **medical-grade electronic thermometers**, as well as industrial and consumer applications. It can serve as a digital replacement for platinum RTDs (PT100, PT500, PT1000) while consuming only a fraction of the power and eliminating the need for precision analog front-end circuitry.  

The device supports **programmable alert limits**, **averaging modes** to reduce noise, and includes a **48-bit general-purpose EEPROM** for system-level calibration or identification. Its low active current and ultra-low shutdown current make it ideal for **battery-powered devices**.
