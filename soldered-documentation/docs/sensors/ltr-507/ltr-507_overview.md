## LTR-507

The LTR-507 Breakout board offers precise **ambient light (ALS)** and **proximity (PS)** measurements, transmitting data via **I2C communication** for easy integration with microcontrollers such as **Dasduino**. The device supports an interrupt feature that eliminates the need to poll the sensor for a reading, thereby improving system efficiency.
