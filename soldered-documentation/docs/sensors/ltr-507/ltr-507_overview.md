## LTR-507

The LTR-507 Breakout board features precise **ambient light (ALS)** and **proximity (PS)** measurements, transmitting data via **I2C communication** for easy integration with microcontrollers like **Dasduino**. The device supports an interrupt feature that removes the
need to poll the sensor for a reading which improves
system efficiency. 

Our breakout board comes **fully assembled**, simplifying setup with the use of **Qwiic (formerly easyC) connectivity** and  eliminating the need for soldering. To get started quickly, we offer a comprehensive **Arduino library**, complete with example codes and detailed documentation.
