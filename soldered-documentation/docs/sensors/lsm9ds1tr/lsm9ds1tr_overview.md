## Accelerometer & Gyroscope & Magnetometer LSM9DS1TR 9-DOF breakout

**Accelerometer, Gyroscope, & Magnetometer - Breakout** is a compact board that integrates a **3D accelerometer**, a **3D gyroscope**, and a **3D magnetometer**, enabling comprehensive tracking of linear acceleration, rotational motion, and orientation in space. Thanks to high measurement resolutions (up to **±16 g** for an accelerometer, **±2000 dps** for a gyroscope, and **±16** gauss for a magnetometer), it is ideal for designing advanced navigation systems, gesture-controlled robots, fitness trackers, drones, and virtual reality applications. The board contains a **built-in temperature sensor** and **FIFO buffer** for efficient data management, where its high resistance to mechanical shock makes the LSM9DS1 a preferred choice for system designers creating and manufacturing reliable products.

It also includes **2 Qwiic (formerly easyC)** connectors, making it easy to connect with microcontrollers. The Qwiic module connection system eliminates the risk of incorrect connections or damaged modules, ensuring a seamless setup experience.
