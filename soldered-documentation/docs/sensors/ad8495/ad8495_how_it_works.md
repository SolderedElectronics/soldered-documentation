## How the sensor works

The AD8495 is a **precision thermocouple amplifier** designed for accurate temperature measurement with K-type thermocouples. It integrates a **cold junction compensation circuit** and an **instrumentation amplifier** to output a **high-level voltage** directly proportional to temperature. 

The amplifier operates based on the **thermoelectric effect**, where a voltage is generated at the junction of two dissimilar metals when subjected to a temperature gradient. This voltage—typically in the microvolt range—is amplified by the AD8495 to provide a clean, linear output of **5 mV/°C**, eliminating the need for complex signal conditioning.
