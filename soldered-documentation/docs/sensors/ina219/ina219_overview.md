## INA219 Voltage & current sensor

The **INA219** is a digital device that allows the measurement of **current**, **voltage**, and therefore **power**. Simply connect a **Qwiic connector** to this device, and it will provide all the information via **I2C communication** at an address of **0x40**. It is very simple and reliable to use. It has a jumper for changing the I2C address, allowing you to connect more than one INA219 to a single microcontroller.

The maximum measurement current is determined by the shunt resistor on the board, which is 0.1 ohm (± 3.2A). It can **measure power in both directions**! If you want to measure higher currents or smaller currents more precisely, consult the datasheet to select a different resistor. The maximum voltage that can be measured is **26V**.
