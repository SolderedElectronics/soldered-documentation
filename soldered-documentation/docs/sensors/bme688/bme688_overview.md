## BME688 Environmental Sensor

The **BME688** is a digital environmental sensor that combines precise environmental monitoring with gas analysis capabilities, measuring organic compounds (VOCs), volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), carbon monoxide, and hydrogen in the parts-per-billion (ppb) range alongside temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure. It's the first sensor that has built-in Artificial Intelligence, allowing developers to customize gas detection for specific applications. This board uses the **I2C communication protocol** with a default address of **0x76**. It has 2 onboard **Qwiic ports** for easy integration.
