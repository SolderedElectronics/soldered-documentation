## Simple rain sensor

The **simple rain sensor breakout board** is a precise sensor that detects if any moisture is present on its surface. It has two nickel-plated lines that are shorted when any moistureis present. It is commonly used as a **rain sensor**.
This sensor also comes in a version with **I2C communication**, with a default address of **0x30**, and is designed for seamless **Qwiic (formerly easyC) connectivity**â€”eliminating the need for soldering.
