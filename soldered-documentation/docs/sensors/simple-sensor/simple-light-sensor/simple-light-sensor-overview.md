## Simple light sensor

The **simple light sensor breakout board** is a precise sensor that detects the presence and intensity of ambient light. This sensor features a light-dependent resistor (LDR) that detects light. This sensor is also available in a version with **I2C communication**, with a default address of **0x30**, and is designed for seamless **Qwiic (formerly easyC) connectivity**—eliminating the need for soldering.
