The **Capacitive Soil Sensor** is a robust and corrosion-resistant device for measuring soil moisture. Unlike resistive sensors that rely on exposed metal probes, this sensor uses a capacitive sensing principle, resulting in longer lifespan and more reliable measurements in harsh environments.

## What’s inside?

This sensor is based on the **TLC555CD** IC – a CMOS version of the popular 555 timer from **Texas Instruments**. It’s used to generate a frequency that changes based on the capacitance of the soil. As soil moisture increases, the capacitance of the sensing area increases, altering the output frequency or voltage.

## How it works

The capacitive soil moisture sensor detects changes in soil moisture using a **capacitive pad**. The pad forms one plate of a capacitor, while the surrounding soil acts as the dielectric. Moisture changes the dielectric constant, affecting the capacitance.

This capacitance is part of an RC (resistor-capacitor) circuit controlled by the TLC555CD timer. As the soil moisture changes, the capacitance shifts, causing the output pulse width or analog voltage to vary. This change can be measured by a microcontroller's **analog input** pin.
