## Capacitive Soil Sensor

The **Capacitive Soil Sensor** monitors soil moisture through the capacitive interaction between the soil and a conductive, coated electrode. Unlike traditional resistive sensors, this sensor avoids corrosion and offers longer durability thanks to its **protective PCB coating**. It’s ideal for long-term soil monitoring in plant care and gardening applications.

## Benefits of Capacitive Sensing

Unlike resistive soil sensors, this capacitive sensor does not expose conductive metal to the soil, which significantly increases lifespan and reliability, especially in constantly wet or acidic environments.
