## VL53L1X Laser Distance Sensor
The **VL53L1X ToF Laser Distance Sensor** is a high-performance **Time-of-Flight (ToF)** laser-ranging sensor. It uses invisible **Class 1** laser emitter (eye-safe) to measure distances up to **4 meters** with incredible speed and accuracy in various ambient lightning or reflectance conditions. The sensor is compact and easy to integrate into a wide range of projects - from detection systems and service robots to drones for landing, hovering and ceiling detection, and even vending machines. It features **I²C communication** and supports quick *plug-and-play* connectivity with **Qwiic (formerly easyC)**, making setup fast and straightforward.
