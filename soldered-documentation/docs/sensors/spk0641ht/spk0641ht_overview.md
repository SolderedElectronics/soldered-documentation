# Overview

## SPK0641HT Microphone

The **SPK0641HT4H-1 Digital SiSonic™ Microphone** is a miniature, high-performance, low-power MEMS microphone with a **top port** and **single-bit PDM output**. Based on Syntiant’s SiSonic™ MEMS technology, it integrates an acoustic sensor, low-noise input buffer, and sigma-delta modulator.  

This device is optimized for **portable electronics** such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, cameras, and recorders, where wideband audio quality and RF immunity are required. Its high **64 dB(A) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)** and flat frequency response make it well-suited for **far-field applications** and multi-microphone arrays.  

In addition, the SPK0641HT4H-1 provides **multiple performance modes**, enabling designers to balance between **low power consumption** and **high-quality capture**.
