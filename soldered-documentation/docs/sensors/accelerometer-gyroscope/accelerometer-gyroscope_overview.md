## Accelerometer & Gyroscope LSM6DS 6-DOF breakout

**Accelerometer & Gyroscope - Breakout** is a compact board that integrates a **3D accelerometer** and a **3D gyroscope**, enabling the tracking of linear acceleration and rotational motion. Thanks to high measurement resolutions (up to ±16 g and ±2000 dps), it is ideal for designing gesture-controlled robots, fitness trackers, or drones. The board contains a built-in **temperature sensor** and **FIFO buffer** for efficient data management, and its high resistance to mechanical shock makes LSM6DS the preferred choice for system designers creating and manufacturing reliable products.  
It also includes **2 Qwiic (formerly easyC) connectors**, making it easy to connect with microcontrollers and eliminating the need for soldering.
