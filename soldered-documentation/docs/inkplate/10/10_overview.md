**Inkplate 10** brings the clarity and efficiency of large-format e-paper to DIY electronics. With its **9.7-inch recycled E-Ink display**, ultra-low power design, and full **Wi-Fi + Bluetooth** support, it’s ideal for smart dashboards, wall-mounted displays, and always-on visual interfaces. Just plug it in and start developing. Inkplate 10 is fully compatible with **Arduino** and **MicroPython**, and it’s entirely **open-source**.

The high-resolution screen supports **grayscale rendering**, **partial updates**, and fast refresh times, while its **ESP32 microcontroller** ensures smooth wireless operation. It also includes a **microSD slot**, **RTC**, and **GPIO expansion** through **I²C, SPI, and EasyC/Qwiic**. Whether battery- or USB-powered, this display works for weeks or months thanks to its energy-efficient design. And with a **3D-printed case and optional battery**, Inkplate 10 is ready to go wherever your project takes it.
