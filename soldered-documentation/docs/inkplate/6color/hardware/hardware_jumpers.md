Inkplate 6COLOR features several **on-board jumpers**, which can be used to modify the behavior of certain components. Some jumpers are **connected by default**, while others need to be manually shorted.

See the table below for a detailed explanation of each jumper's function:

## Board jumpers

| **Jumper** | **Default State** | **Function** |
|---|---|---|
| **JP1** | **Connected to IO34 by default** | Switch between connecting the Interrupt pin of the IO expander to the IO34 pin on the ESP32 or the K1 output header on the board |
| **JP2** | **Connected to P1_2 by default** | Switch between connecting the SD_ENABLE pin of the microSD card reader to pin 12 on the IO expander or the K20 output header on the board |
| **JP3** | **Connected to P1_1 by default** | Switch between connecting the V_BAT_MOS pin to pin 12 on the IO expander or the K26 output header on the board |
| **JP4** | **NO** (not connected) | When shorted, it keeps the microSD card powered at 3.3V at all times. Useful for troubleshooting, but not ideal for low-power applications. |
| **JP5** | **Connected to GPIO39 by default** | Switch between connecting the interrupt pin of the RTC to the GPIO39 pin or to the CLKOUT_RTC pin |
| **JP6** | **Connected to SPI_CS(IO15) by default** | Switch between connecting the CS pin of the microSD card reader to the IO15 pin or the SD0 pin on the ESP32 |
