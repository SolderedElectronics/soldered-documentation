<WarningBox>This page contains important information about using a battery with Inkplate 6COLOR. For safety reasons, **please read this page carefully!**</WarningBox>  

Inkplate 6COLOR includes a **2-pin 2mm JST connector**, allowing you to connect a **3.7V Li-ion battery**. The onboard charging IC, **MCP73831**, **automatically charges the battery** when Inkplate is plugged into **USB-C**, and it switches to battery power when unplugged. A **charging indicator LED** provides real-time charging status.

## Charging IC (MCP73831)  

The **MCP73831** is a compact, single-cell **Li-ion/Li-Polymer charge management controller**. It regulates the **charging process**, ensuring safe and efficient charging via USB. The chip follows a **constant-current / constant-voltage (CC/CV) charging profile**, automatically switching to **trickle charge** when the battery nears full capacity.  

Key features:  
- **Automatic charge termination** when the battery is full  
- **Overvoltage and overcurrent protection**  
- **Charge status indicator** (connected to the onboard LED)
