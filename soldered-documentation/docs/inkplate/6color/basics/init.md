Let's get started writing our first Inkplate sketch! Before using Inkplate in Arduino code, it must be initialized in the `setup()` function of your sketch. This page contains details on how to do that.

## Initializing Inkplate and updating the display

The most basic sketch on Inkplate 6COLOR is as follows. It initializes Inkplate in memory and clears the e-paper display:

```cpp
#include <Inkplate.h>
Inkplate inkplate; // Create Inkplate object
void setup() 
{
  // Initialize Inkplate
  inkplate.begin();
  // Update the display
  inkplate.display();
  // As the frame buffer is empty upon initialization, this will display a blank screen
}
void loop() 
{
  // Do nothing here
}
```
<FunctionDocumentation
  functionName="Inkplate inkplate"
  description="Creates an Inkplate object from the Inkplate class."
  returnType="none"
/>
<FunctionDocumentation
  functionName="inkplate.begin()"
  description="In short, this function initializes the Inkplate object. It starts I2C, allocates the required memory for the frame buffer, and initializes the onboard peripherals."
  returnType="none"
/>
<FunctionDocumentation
  functionName="inkplate.display()"
  description="This function refreshes the display and draws what is currently in the frame buffer. To update the display, this function must be called. This is a full refresh that completely wipes the e-Paper and then draws everything from the frame buffer."
  returnType="none"
  parameters={[ 
    { type: 'uint8_t ', name: '_leaveOn', description: "Optional. If set to true, the e-Paper won't be turned off after the refresh - this speeds up consecutive refreshes. It's best to use this with partialUpdate and not with this function." },
  ]}
/>

## Display rotation

In case you want to use Inkplate in portrait mode or in any 90-degree rotation, use `inkplate.setRotation()`:
<FunctionDocumentation
  functionName="inkplate.setRotation()"
  description="Sets the cardinal rotation of the display. This automatically adjusts the (0, 0) x-y coordinate origin point."
  returnDescription="none"
  parameters={[ 
    { type: 'uint8_t ', name: '_rotation', description: "Ranges from 0 to 270. 0 is the default rotation; 1 rotates by 90 degrees, 2 by 180 degrees, and 3 by 270 degrees." },
  ]}
/>
