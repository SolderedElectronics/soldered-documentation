Soldered Image Converter is an open-source Python program by Soldered. It is used to convert images for Inkplate boards into .h files, which can be included in Arduino sketches for Inkplate and then displayed.

After converting images, export the .h files and save them in your Inkplate sketch's project folder. To locate this folder, go to `Sketch -> Show Sketch Folder` in Arduino.

Once the exported .h files are in the folder, include them in the sketch and use the `drawImage` function.
