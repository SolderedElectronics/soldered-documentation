Soldered Image Converter is an open-source Python program created by Soldered. It converts images for Inkplate boards into .h files, which can be included in Arduino sketches for Inkplate and then displayed.

After converting images, export the .h files and save them in your Inkplate sketch's project folder. To find this folder, go to `Sketch -> Show Sketch Folder` in Arduino.

Place the exported .h files in that folder, then include them in the sketch and use the `drawImage` function.
