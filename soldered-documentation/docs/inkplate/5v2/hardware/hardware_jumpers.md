Inkplate 5V2 features several **on-board jumpers**, which can be used to modify the behavior of certain components. Some jumpers are **connected by default**, while others need to be manually shorted.

See the table below for a detailed explanation of each jumper's function:

## Board jumpers

| **Jumper** | **Default State** | **Function** |
|---|---|---|
| **JP1** 	| **NO** (not connected) 	| When shorted, it keeps the microSD card powered at 3.3v at all times. Useful for troubleshooting, but not ideal for low-power applications. |
| **JP2** | **Connected to INT by default** | Switch between a digital, open-drain, active low interrupt output and a programmable digital square-wave output that can be used as a system clock. |
| **JP3** | **Connected to SPI_CS(IO15) by default** | Switch between connecting the CS pin of the microSD card reader to the IO15 pin or the SD0 pin on the ESP32. |
| **JP4** | **NO** (not connected) | When shorted, bypasses the 330-ohm resistor connected to the buffer, causing the ESP32 to enter bootloader mode. |
| **JP5** | **NC** (connected) | When shorted, it connects the GPIO0 pin to a 100pF capacitor which provides more stable voltages. |
| **JP6** | **Connected to IO34 by default** | Switch between connecting the INTB pin of the IO expander to the IO34 pin of the ESP32 or to the IO14 user-accessible pin. |
| **JP7** | **NC** (connected) | When shorted, provides 3.3V to the MicroSD card through the IO expander. |
| **JP8** | **NC** (connected) 	| When shorted, it connects the battery terminal to MCP73831. |
