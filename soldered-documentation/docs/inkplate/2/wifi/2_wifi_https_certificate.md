Now that Inkplate is connected to the internet, you will likely want to securely receive data from a website. This page contains an example of how to implement an HTTPS certificate into your connection.

## HTTPS example
This example will show you how to download a .bmp file from the web securely by providing a certificate for the website that will be validated upon connection. Using `applyHttpsCertificate()` you can store the certificate for your connection:

```cpp
Inkplate inkplate;
const char* certificate = ""; //insert your certificate
//..
void setup(){
    inkplate.applyHttpsCertificate(certificate);
}
//...
```

<FunctionDocumentation
  functionName="inkplate.applyHttpsCertificate()"
  description="Applies a certificate that will be checked when communicating with a website."
  returnType="void"
  parameters={[
    { type: 'const char*', name: 'certificate', description: 'The certificate in a string format.' },
  ]}
/>
