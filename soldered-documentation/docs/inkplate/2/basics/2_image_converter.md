Soldered Image Converter is an open-source Python program developed by Soldered. It is used to convert images for Inkplate boards into .h files, which can then be included in Arduino sketches for Inkplate and displayed.

After converting the images, export the .h files and save them in your Inkplate sketch's project folder. To find this folder, go to `Sketch -> Show Sketch Folder` in Arduino.

Place the exported .h files in that folder, then include them in the sketch and use the `drawImage` function.
