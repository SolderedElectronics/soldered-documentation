The built-in microSD card slot on Inkplate 10 can be extremely useful for your project. It can store a very large number of high-quality image files for display and manage reading and writing data between deep sleep cycles. This page contains basic examples to help you quickly get started with using the built-in microSD card slot.

<InfoBox>Inkplate 10 uses the [**SdFat library**](https://github.com/greiman/SdFat)</InfoBox>
<WarningBox>All supported card formats are: **FAT16, FAT32, exFAT**</WarningBox>
<WarningBox>All supported card types are: **SD, SDHC and SDXC**</WarningBox>

## Preparing the microSD card before usage

For best results, use the [**official SD card formatter**](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/) to format the card to **FAT32** before usage.

## Initializing

Before the microSD card can be used in code, it must first be initialized. This powers on the microSD card circuitry and performs all of the necessary memory allocations. In this code snippet, the microSD card is initialized and the result of the initialization is checked:
```cpp
#include "Inkplate.h"            // Include Inkplate library in the sketch
#include "SdFat.h"               // Include library for SD card
Inkplate inkplate(INKPLATE_1BIT); // Create an object of the Inkplate library and set the library to 1 Bit mode (BW)
SdFile file;                     // Create SdFile object used for accessing files on the SD card

void setup()
{
    inkplate.begin();        // Initialize Inkplate library (you should call this function ONLY ONCE)
    inkplate.clearDisplay(); // Clear the frame buffer of the display
    inkplate.display();      // Put a clear image on the display
    inkplate.setTextSize(5);

    // Initialize SD card. Display whether the SD card is initialized properly or not.
    if (inkplate.sdCardInit())
    {
        inkplate.println("SD Card ok! Reading data...");
        inkplate.partialUpdate();
    }
    else
    { // If card initialization was not successful, display an error on the screen, put the SD card in sleep mode, and stop the program (using an infinite loop)
        inkplate.println("SD Card error!");        
        inkplate.partialUpdate();
        inkplate.sdCardSleep();
        while (true)
            ;
    }
}
void loop()
{
    // Nothing...
}
```

    returnDescription="Returns true if the initialization was successful, otherwise returns false."

## Reading and writing

Place a sample `text.txt` file on the microSD card with some content in it; this code snippet will read the file and print its contents to the e-Paper:
```cpp
/*
   Inkplate10_SD_TXT_Read example for Soldered Inkplate 10
   For this example you will need only a micro USB cable, Inkplate 10 and an SD card
   loaded with a text.txt file that can be found inside the folder of this example.
   Select "e-radionica Inkplate10" or "Soldered Inkplate10" from the Tools -> Board menu.
   Don't see the "e-radionica Inkplate10" or "Soldered Inkplate10" option? Follow our tutorial and add it:
   https://soldered.com/learn/add-inkplate-6-board-definition-to-arduino-ide/

   To work with the SD card on Inkplate, you will need to add one extra library.
   Download and install it from here: https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-6-SDFat-Arduino-Library

   You can use your own .txt file, but for this example to work properly it should
   not have more than 200 characters and you should name it text.txt

   This example will show you how to open .txt files and display the content of that file on the Inkplate e-paper display.

<InfoBox>In the above-mentioned functions, the file pointer acts like a marker indicating where to continue reading the file, so subsequent calls to `file.print()` will continue from where you left off.</InfoBox>

<InfoBox>Using this method, it's possible to write to a .csv file, making it easy to store a table or log of events!</InfoBox>
