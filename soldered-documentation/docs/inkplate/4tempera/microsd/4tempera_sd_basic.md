The built-in microSD card slot on Inkplate 4TEMPERA can be extremely useful for your project. It can store a vast number of high-quality image files to be displayed, and it can also read and write data during deep sleep cycles. This page contains basic examples that will help you quickly get started with using the built-in microSD card slot.

<InfoBox>Inkplate 4TEMPERA uses the [**SdFat library**](https://github.com/greiman/SdFat)</InfoBox>
<WarningBox>All supported card formats are: **FAT16, FAT32, exFAT**</WarningBox>
<WarningBox>All supported card types are: **SD, SDHC and SDXC**</WarningBox>

## Preparing the microSD card before usage

For best results, use the [**official SD card formatter**](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/) to format the card to **FAT32** before use.

## Initializing

Before the microSD card can be used in code, it must first be initialized. This process powers on the microSD card circuitry and performs all the necessary memory allocations. In this code snippet, the microSD card is initialized, and the result of the initialization is checked:
```cpp
#include "Inkplate.h"            // Include Inkplate library to the sketch
#include "SdFat.h"               // Include library for SD card
Inkplate inkplate(INKPLATE_1BIT); // Create an object on Inkplate library and also set library into 1 Bit mode (BW)
SdFile file;                     // Create SdFile object used for accessing files on SD card

void setup()
{
    inkplate.begin();        // Initialize Inkplate library (you should call this function ONLY ONCE)
    inkplate.clearDisplay(); // Clear frame buffer of display
    inkplate.display();      // Put clear image on display
    inkplate.setTextSize(5);

    // Initialize SD card and display whether it was initialized properly.
    if (inkplate.sdCardInit())
    {
        inkplate.println("SD Card ok! Reading data...");
        inkplate.partialUpdate();
    }
    else
    { // If initialization fails, display an error on the screen, put the SD card in sleep mode, and stop the program (using an infinite loop)
        inkplate.println("SD Card error!");        
        inkplate.partialUpdate();
        inkplate.sdCardSleep();
        while (true)
            ;
    }
}
void loop()
{
    // Nothing...
}
```

    description="Initializes the SD card through SPI."
    returnDescription="Returns true if the initialization was successful, otherwise returns false."

## Reading and writing
Place a sample `text.txt` file on the microSD card and add some content to it. This code snippet will read the file and print its contents to the e-Paper:
```cpp
/*
   Inkplate4TEMPERA_SD_TXT_Read example for Soldered Inkplate 4TEMPERA
   For this example you will need only a micro USB cable, Inkplate 4TEMPERA, and an SD card
   loaded with the text.txt file found inside the example folder.
   Select "Soldered Inkplate 4TEMPERA" from Tools -> Board menu.
   Don't see the "Inkplate 4TEMPERA(ESP32)" option? Follow our tutorial to add it:
   https://soldered.com/learn/add-inkplate-6-board-definition-to-arduino-ide/

   To work with the SD card on Inkplate, you will need to add one extra library.
   Download and install it from here: https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-6-SDFat-Arduino-Library

   You can open your own .txt file, but to ensure this example works properly, the file should
   contain no more than 200 characters and must be named text.txt.

   This example will show you how to open .txt files and display the content of that file on the Inkplate e-Paper display.

<InfoBox>In the functions mentioned above, the file pointer acts as a marker indicating where to continue reading the file, so subsequent calls to file.print() will continue from where you left off.</InfoBox>

<InfoBox>Using this method, it's possible to write to a .csv file, making it easy to store a table or log of events!</InfoBox>
