Inkplate is a **crowdfunded, open-source project**, and its software libraries build upon other free, community-driven libraries. Open-source has been essential to the development of Inkplate, and at [**Soldered Electronics**](https://soldered.com/about-us/), we believe in giving back by sharing the knowledge and resources we've gained along the way.
