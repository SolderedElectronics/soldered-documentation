**Inkplate 6** brings the power and elegance of **6-inch e-paper** to the hands of makers, students, and product designers. Designed for low-power, always-on display applications, it features a **recycled 800×600 pixel E-Ink screen**, an **ESP32 microcontroller**, and full **Wi-Fi + Bluetooth** connectivity all in a plug-and-play, Arduino-compatible form factor. It supports **grayscale rendering**, **partial updates**, and is optimized for both performance and sustainability.

With support for Arduino (Adafruit GFX-compatible) and MicroPython, plus easy expansion via GPIO, I²C, SPI, and the EasyC/Qwiic ecosystem, **Inkplate 6** is ideal for low-energy projects that demand crystal-clear, sunlight-readable display output. Its recycled e-reader displays give new life to unused screens, making it an eco-conscious choice for modern prototyping.
